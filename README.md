# Welcome to Brain_games
This's serie just logic-games.
* **brain-calc** - In this game you have to perform basic mathematical operations - addition, subtraction and multiplication.
* **brain-even** - In this game you must determine - whether the number is even or not. If the number is even, you must answer “yes”, if not even, then “no”.
* **brain-gcd** - In this game you will be presented with two numbers. You need to analyze them and find the largest number by which they are divided without a remainder.
* **brain-prime** - In this game you must determine whether the number shown is prime. If it’s purely simple, you must answer “yes”, if not simple, then “no”. A prime number is a number that is divisible without remainder only by itself and by one.
* **brain-progression** - In this game you will be presented with a series of numbers. You must find a pattern between them and enter the missing number.
